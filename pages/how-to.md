This page is for you if you've already mastered the content in the icepack tutorials, and now you want to run large, complex, and realistic simulations of glaciers and ice sheets.
Here we'll show you what you need to know to maximize the performance out of icepack, how to couple to other models, how to run suites of simulations to explore parameter sensitivity, how to check simulation results for accuracy after the fact, and more.

The goal of these how-to guides is to help you move from just learning to simulate glacier flow to producing the kinds of simulations that you can publish peer-reviewed articles about in scholarly journals.
If you've reached this point, you've probably used icepack enough to have found things you need that we don't offer yet.
You can look at the page on development of icepack to learn what new features are going to be added soon and how to let the developers of icepack know what new features are important to you
Finally, the developer documentation explains the process for how you can contribute new code or tutorials to icepack and how you too can become part of the development team.
